# EasyMYP (AKA TorMYP)
This EasyMYP tool variant can inspect and extract assets from SWTOR's .tor packs.

## WARNING: EasyMYP is not compatible with the 64 bit version of SWTOR (Game Update 7.2.1 onwards) and won't be developed any further. 

* **As an extraction tool, it has been superseded by the [**ExtracTOR**](https://github.com/UltimaKaosXIII/extracTOR) app, whose usage is far simpler and faster.**

* **As a .tor file inspection tool, its functionality can be reproduced with [jedipedia.net's SWTOR File Reader](https://swtor.jedipedia.net/reader).**
